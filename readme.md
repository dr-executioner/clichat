# 🧋 BubbleChat

A lightweight CLI chat app built with [Go](https://golang.org), [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), and the amazing [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) TUI framework.

> Minimal. Beautiful. Real-time.

## ✨ Features

- 📡 **Real-time messaging** using WebSockets
- 💬 **Interactive terminal UI** powered by Bubbletea & Lipgloss
- 🧠 **Simple architecture** with hub-based broadcast model
- 🔧 Built with idiomatic Go using `net/http` and `gorilla/websocket`

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the server

```bash
cd server
go run .
```

> Server runs on `localhost:8080` by default

---

### 2. Run a client

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd client
go run .
```

Open another terminal and run the client again to simulate another user.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Each client connects to the server via WebSocket
- A central **Hub** manages all active connections
- Messages are sent to the hub and **broadcast to all clients**
- Each TUI client updates in real-time using Bubbletea's reactive model
